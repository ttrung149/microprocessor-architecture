# Microprocessor Architecture

Notes/Study guide for EE14: Microprocessor Architecture class at Tufts. See Wiki for more details.

EE14 mainly covered the use of ARM Assembly, the `STM32L4 Discovery Kit`, and `Keil IDE`. However, since Keil IDE is rather difficult to setup and not portable, I decided to use Makefile, ST-link tools, and [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) to compile and flash code on a `STM32F103C8T6` board. This board is very affordable and has pretty much the same functionalities as the Discovery Kit, so it might be a better choice for those who want to get into ARM MCU development without going through the setup hassle.
